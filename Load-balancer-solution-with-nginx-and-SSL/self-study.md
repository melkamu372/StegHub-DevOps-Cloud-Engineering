# Read more about HTTP load balancing methods and features supported by Nginx 
Nginx is a powerful and flexible HTTP server and reverse proxy that supports various load balancing methods and features. Hereâ€™s an overview of the HTTP load balancing methods and key features supported by Nginx:
## Load Balancing Methods

1. **Round Robin**
 Distributes client requests sequentially to the backend servers in a cyclic manner.
Use case: Default and simplest load balancing method, suitable for evenly distributed loads across servers.
```
upstream backend {
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
    server backend3.example.com;
}

```
2. **Least Connections** Sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
Use case: Useful when the servers have varying capacities or when the load varies significantly.
```
upstream backend {
    least_conn;
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
    server backend3.example.com;
}

```
3. **IP Hash** Routes requests from the same client IP to the same backend server.
Use case: Ensures session persistence by sending a client to the same server based on the client's IP address.
upstream backend {
    ip_hash;
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
    server backend3.example.com;
}
4. **Generic Hash** Allows the use of a custom hash key for load balancing, such as a specific header, cookie, or other request attribute.
Use case: Provides flexible session persistence based on custom parameters.
```
upstream backend {
    hash $request_uri consistent;
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
    server backend3.example.com;
}

```
