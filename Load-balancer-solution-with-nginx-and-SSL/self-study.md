# Read more about HTTP load balancing methods and features supported by Nginx 
Nginx is a powerful and flexible HTTP server and reverse proxy that supports various load balancing methods and features.
Load balancing across multiple application instances is a commonly used technique for optimizing resource utilization, maximizing throughput, reducing latency, and ensuring faultâ€‘tolerant configurations. Here's an overview of the HTTP load balancing methods and key features supported by Nginx:

## Load Balancing Methods
Nginx supports several load balancing methods, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The most commonly used methods are listed below.
1. **Round Robin**
The round-robin method is the simplest and most widely used load balancing algorithm. It distributes incoming requests evenly across a set of servers in a cyclic order. Each server is given an equal number of requests, so the load is balanced evenly. This method is best suited for applications with similar server capabilities and workloads.
```
upstream backend {
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
    server backend3.example.com;
}

```
2. **Least Connections** Sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
Use case: Useful when the servers have varying capacities or when the load varies significantly.
```
upstream backend {
    least_conn;
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
    server backend3.example.com;
}

```
3. **IP Hash** Routes requests from the same client IP to the same backend server. In this method, the requests from the same client (i.e. same IP Address as the last request) are always sent to the same backend server. This is useful for applications that require session persistence, such as e-commerce sites or online banking applications.
```
upstream backend {
    ip_hash;
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
    server backend3.example.com;
}
```
In this configuration, the ip_hash directive is used to instruct Nginx to use the IP hash method. The rest of the configuration is similar to the round-robin example.
4. **Generic Hash** Allows the use of a custom hash key for load balancing, such as a specific header, cookie, or other request attribute.
Use case: Provides flexible session persistence based on custom parameters.
```
upstream backend {
    hash $request_uri consistent;
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
    server backend3.example.com;
}

```
## Load Balancing Features
1. **Health Checks**: Regularly checks the health of backend servers to ensure traffic is only sent to healthy servers.
Use case: Improves availability and reliability by automatically bypassing unhealthy servers.
```
http {
    upstream backend {
        server backend1.example.com;
        server backend2.example.com;
        server backend3.example.com;
        server backend4.example.com down;
    }

    server {
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
            proxy_next_upstream error timeout http_500 http_502 http_503 http_504;
            proxy_connect_timeout 1s;
            proxy_read_timeout 1s;
            proxy_send_timeout 1s;
            proxy_intercept_errors on;
        }
    }
}
```
2. **Session Persistence (Sticky Sessions)**: Ensures that a user's requests are sent to the same backend server for the duration of their session.
Use case: Useful for applications that store session data locally on the server.
```
upstream backend {
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
    sticky cookie srv_id expires=1h domain=.example.com path=/;
}
```
3.  **Dynamic Reconfiguration**: Allows for adding or removing backend servers without restarting Nginx.It Provides flexibility in managing server pools dynamically.
```
http {
    upstream backend {
        zone backend 64k;
        server backend1.example.com;
        server backend2.example.com;
    }

    server {
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }
}
```
4. **SSL Termination**: Terminates SSL/TLS connections at the load balancer, offloading the encryption/decryption process from backend servers. It Simplifies SSL management and reduces load on backend servers.
```
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/example.com.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/example.com.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}

```
