# Understanding Client-Server Architecture

**Client-Server** refers to an architecture in which two or more computers are connected together over a network to send and receive requests between one another.

In their communication, each machine has its own role: the machine `sending` requests is usually referred as *Client* and the machine responding (serving) is called *Server*.
