# Web stack(LEMP) Implimentation IN AWS Module 2
> LEMP stack is a popular open-source software stack typically used for web development. It's similar to the more commonly known LAMP stack but substitutes Apache with Nginx as the web server. Here's what each letter stands for:

- **L: Linux**, the operating system on which the stack runs.
- **E: Nginx** (pronounced "engine x"), the web server software.
- **M: MySQL** or MariaDB, the database management system.
- **P: PHP**, Python, or Perl, the programming languages used for server-side scripting.
So, in essence, the LEMP stack consists of Linux, Nginx, MySQL/MariaDB, and PHP/Python/Perl. It's a powerful combination for serving dynamic websites and web applications.
