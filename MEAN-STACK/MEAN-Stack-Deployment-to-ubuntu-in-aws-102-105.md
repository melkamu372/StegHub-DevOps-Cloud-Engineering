#  MEAN Stack Deployment to Ubuntu in AWS- project 4. 

> The MEAN stack is a popular open-source JavaScript software stack used for building dynamic web applications. The name "MEAN" is an acronym that stands for:

1. MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents. It's known for its flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.

2. Express.js: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js. Express.js simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a robust set of features for handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and more.

3. Angular (formerly AngularJS): A front-end JavaScript framework maintained by Google. Angular provides a comprehensive toolkit for building single-page applications (SPAs) with features like data binding, dependency injection, routing, and more.

4. Node.js: A server-side JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js enables developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it possible to build server-side applications and APIs using JavaScript.


# Step 0 - Preparing prerequisites

> In order to complete this project you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS.



> Hint: In previous projects we used different tools to connect to an EC2
instance, but if you do not want to install or launch anything outside of

AWS, you can open youc CLI straight from Web Console in AWS, like this:
