# Orchestrating Containers across multiple virtual servers with kubernetes

## K8s From-Ground-Up

Let us begin building out Kubernetes cluster from the ground

**DISCLAIMER:** The following setup of Kubernetes should be used for learning purpose only, and not to be considered for production.
This is because setting up a K8s cluster for production use has a lot more moving parts, especially when it comes to planning the 
nodes, and securing the cluster. The purpose of **"K8s From-Ground-Up"** is to get you much closer to the different components as shown in the architecture diagram and relate with what you have been learning about Kubernetes.


**Tools to be used and expected result of the Project 20**

- VM: AWS EC2
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 lts+
- Docker Engine
- kubectl console utility
- cfssl and cfssljson utilities
- Kubernetes cluster


**You will create 3 EC2 Instances, and in the end, we will have the following parts of the cluster properly configured:**

- One Kubernetes Master
- Two Kubernetes Worker Nodes
- Configured SSL/TLS certificates for Kubernetes components to communicate securely
- Configured Node Network
- Configured Pod Network
